### Location Data
Users can optionally provide their phone GPS data to set their location when using the Solar Elevation tool. This data is sent to OpenStreetMap as a co-ordinate pair (e.g. 40.7128° N, 74.0060° W) with no otherwise identifying information. This data is not stored elsewhere or otherwise. Users can revoke access to location tracking at any time through their device's settings menu. Please refer to manufacturer guidance for exact instructions. OpenStreetMap's privacy policy can be found [here](https://wiki.osmfoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_Policy).
